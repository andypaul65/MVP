### Revised Staged Development Approach

The following restates the iterative development stages for the MVP client-server framework, incorporating the cyberpunk-style UX enhancements (dark gray/black/green theme) as outlined in the proposed document additions. These integrations emphasize modularity, ensuring thematic elements are applied through extensible hooks and global stylesheets without increasing complexity. Each stage remains committable and verifiable, with references to updated design documents for traceability. Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), and 80%+ code coverage.

1. **Stage 1: Client-Side Skeleton (Achieved)**  
   Initialize the Vite, React, and TypeScript project structure, including folders such as `src/components`, `src/hooks`, and `src/services`. Verify via successful `npm run dev` launch, displaying the default template at http://localhost:5173. No UX changes at this foundational stage. Commit message: "Client skeleton established per architecture.md."
   Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), 80%+ code coverage, successful `npm run build` (to ensure type safety and bundling integrity), and `npm test` (to validate all tests pass). If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

2. **Stage 2: Core Tabbed Interface Implementation**  
   Implement `TabbedInterface.tsx` with `TabConfig` interface, including example snippet and extension hooks. Integrate basic cyberpunk UX by adding a global stylesheet (e.g., `cyberpunk.css`) defining dark gray backgrounds (#1E1E1E), black elements (#000000), and green accents (#00FF00); apply via class names in the component. Update `TabConfig` for optional style props. Generate and run unit tests asserting theme application (e.g., color matches via Jest). Verify tab navigation and styling in the browser, followed by `npm run build` to ensure type safety and bundling integrity. Commit message: "Tabbed interface with cyberpunk theme per MVP UI Design Specification.". Commit message: "Tabbed interface with cyberpunk theme per MVP UI Design Specification."
   Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), 80%+ code coverage, successful `npm run build` (to ensure type safety and bundling integrity), and `npm test` (to validate all tests pass). If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

3. **Stage 3: MVP Tabs (Debug and Control Panel)**  
   Develop `DebugPanel.tsx` and `ControlPanel.tsx`, integrating `useSystemState` hook for state and message tracking. Enhance with cyberpunk styling, such as green-highlighted logs on black panels for the Debug tab and themed message displays for Control. Wire into `TabbedInterface` with namespace-specific initialization. MSW automatically provides API mocks in development mode, enabling full client functionality without server dependency. Include integration tests using MSW and style assertions. Verify real-time updates and visual consistency via browser inspection, followed by `npm run build` and `npm test` to confirm no errors. Commit message: "MVP tabs with UX enhancements per framework-patterns.md."
   Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), 80%+ code coverage, successful `npm run build` (to ensure type safety and bundling integrity), and `npm test` (to validate all tests pass). If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

4. **Stage 4: Server-Side Skeleton**  
   Generate Spring Boot project structure in `server/`, including packages for controllers, services, and entities. Implement interfaces like `SystemStateService` and DTOs (e.g., `MessageDto`). Configure Actuator for debugging. No direct UX impact, but ensure DTOs support themed client displays. Verify build with `./mvnw clean install`. Commit message: "Server skeleton per architecture.md."
   Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), 80%+ code coverage, successful `npm run build` (to ensure type safety and bundling integrity), and `npm test` (to validate all tests pass). If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

5. **Stage 5: Server Endpoints and Communication**  
   Create `MvpController.java` with namespace-specific REST endpoints (e.g., `/api/state/{namespace}`) and heartbeat. Integrate client services for JSON payloads. Test endpoints with Postman and full-stack interactions, confirming message flows render correctly with cyberpunk styling. Commit message: "Server endpoints integrated per communication layer guidelines."
   Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), 80%+ code coverage, successful `npm run build` (to ensure type safety and bundling integrity), and `npm test` (to validate all tests pass). If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

5.5 **Stage 5.5: Enhanced Testing and Integration with Vitest**
    ***Testing Coverage***: Added comprehensive Vitest unit tests for key client files (src/hooks/useSystemState.ts, src/services/apiService.ts) covering state updates, API fetches, and error scenarios. Added Spring Boot integration tests for controllers and services using @SpringBootTest and MockMvc, testing API endpoints for success/failure cases. Verified >80% coverage with npm test.
    ***Integration Issues***: Wrapped client API calls with try-catch for robust error handling and state updates. Implemented server-side @ExceptionHandler for consistent error responses. Tested integration with simulated network failures and verified state sync using Vitest mocks.
5.6 **Stage 5.6: WebSockets** âœ… COMPLETED
Implemented WebSockets using Spring's @MessageMapping and client's STOMP over SockJS API. Added minimal /ws endpoint to api-contracts.json with SockJS fallback support. Client now receives real-time state updates while maintaining HTTP fallback for reliability.

6. **Stage 6: Testing and Debugging Hooks**  
   Add comprehensive unit (Vitest/JUnit) and integration tests (MSW/SpringBootTest) per updated testing-guidelines.md, including UX-specific assertions for themes. Enable debugging tools (e.g., React DevTools, Actuator). Run all tests to achieve 80%+ coverage. Commit message: "Full testing suite with UX verification."
   Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), 80%+ code coverage, successful `npm run build` (to ensure type safety and bundling integrity), and `npm test` (to validate all tests pass). If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

7. **Stage 7: Final Extensions and Refinements**  
   Introduce placeholder future tabs via `TabConfig` with cyberpunk styling. Perform end-to-end testing with Cypress, reviewing extensibility and overall polish. Update /docs with any refinements to living documents. Commit message: "Framework MVP complete with cyberpunk UX."
   Implement authentication and advanced state syncing, including endpoints in api-contracts.json.
   Progression criteria include functional testing, style verification (e.g., via browser inspection and unit tests), 80%+ code coverage, successful `npm run build` (to ensure type safety and bundling integrity), and `npm test` (to validate all tests pass). If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

This revised approach aligns with the enhanced documents, treating UX as an extensible layer applied progressively in client-focused stages. If discrepancies arise during implementation, iterative refinements can be prompted via Grok Code Fast, referencing the updated specifications.

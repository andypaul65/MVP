### Overview
Testing is integral to the framework, ensuring reliability and serving as executable documentation. Develop tests alongside code, starting with design specs that outline expected behaviors.

### Unit Testing
- **Client-Side (Jest with React Testing Library)**: Test components in isolation. Include example data:
  ```typescript
  import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
  import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

  test('renders label correctly', () => {
    render(<MyComponent label="Test Label" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Label:')).toBeInTheDocument(); // Educational: Asserts presence for UI verification.
  });
  ```
- **Server-Side (JUnit with Mockito)**: Mock dependencies via interfaces:
  ```java
  @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
  class DataServiceTest {
      @Mock private DataRepository repository;
      @InjectMocks private DataServiceImpl service;

      @Test
      void getById_returnsData() {
          Data mockData = new Data(); // Example data fixture.
          when(repository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockData));
          assertEquals(mockData, service.getById(1L));
      }
  }
  ```

### Integration Testing
- **Client-Side**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to simulate API responses with example data.
- **Server-Side**: Employ Spring Boot's `@SpringBootTest` for end-to-end checks, including database interactions.
- **Full Stack**: Test client-server interactions via tools like Cypress, focusing on API contracts.

### Best Practices
- Cover 80%+ code with tests, including edge cases.
- Use fixtures directories for example data to promote reusability and clarity.

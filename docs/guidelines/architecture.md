# Overview
This document outlines the high-level architecture for the client-server framework, serving as a modular "back plane" layer. The design prioritizes clarity, extensibility, and ease of debugging over rapid development. It establishes a bedrock structure that can be extended for various applications through interfaces, abstractions, and hooks. The client side uses JavaScript with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Vite for a functional, educational setup that is straightforward to understand and maintain, even for those new to these technologies. The server side employs Java with Spring Boot for robust backend services.
# Core Principles

## Modularity: 
All components are designed as independent modules with well-defined interfaces. This allows for easy swapping, extension, or reuse across applications.
Abstractions and Hooks: Provide abstract classes and interfaces with extension points (e.g., lifecycle hooks) to facilitate customization without altering core logic.
## Clarity and Education: 
Include inline comments explaining key concepts, especially for client-side technologies, to aid learning and debugging.
## Testing Integration: 
Every module must include design specifications, unit tests, and integration tests developed iteratively.
## Debugging Support: 
Bake in hooks for tools like Spring Boot Actuator for server monitoring and React DevTools for client-side inspection.
Incorporate a simple heartbeat between the client and server.

# Client-Side Architecture (React, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite)

## Structure: 
Organize into folders such as src/components for reusable UI elements, src/services for API interactions, and src/hooks for custom React hooks. Use Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement to simplify development.

## Key Abstractions:
Define interfaces for props and state (e.g., interface ComponentProps { id: string; onUpdate: () => void; }) to enforce type safety and modularity.
Implement custom hooks (e.g., useApiFetch) for data fetching, with educational comments explaining React's useEffect and useState.
## Extension Hooks: 
Provide overridable methods or callbacks in base components for application-specific behavior.
##  Debugging Hooks: 
Integrate React DevTools by default; include console logging with clear messages and use TypeScript's strict mode for early error detection. For Vite, configure source maps for precise error tracing.
## UX and Styling
Incorporate modular styling mechanisms, such as CSS modules or Tailwind CSS, to 
support thematic customizations. For the MVP, adopt a cyberpunk aesthetic featuring dark gray (#1E1E1E) backgrounds, black (#000000) elements, and green (#00FF00) accents for highlights. This enhances user engagement without introducing complexity, leveraging extension hooks for theme overrides while maintaining accessibility and readability.

# Server-Side Architecture (Java, Spring Boot)

## Structure: 
Use layered architecture with controllers, services, repositories, and entities. Organize into packages like com.example.controllers and com.example.services.
## Key Abstractions:

All services implement interfaces (e.g., public interface UserService { User getUserById(long id); }) to support dependency injection and mocking.
Use Spring Boot's @Configuration for modular setup, allowing overrides via profiles.


## Extension Hooks:
 Define abstract services with protected methods for subclasses to extend core functionality.
## Debugging Hooks: 
Enable Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (e.g., /actuator/health, /actuator/metrics) for runtime monitoring. Include logging with SLF4J and advise using IntelliJ's debugger with breakpoints in services.

# Communication Layer

Use RESTful APIs with JSON payloads for client-server interaction. Define shared interfaces or DTOs for data models to ensure consistency.
Include hooks for authentication (e.g., JWT) and error handling, with abstractions for custom middleware.

# Development Workflow
Start with design specs in separate Markdown files per module (e.g., module-design-spec.md).
Iteratively develop code, tests(80%+ coverage), verification (including `npm run build` for client-side type checking and optimization), and documentation, emphasizing clarity through peer-reviewable comments.

## Iterative Committable Stages: 
Structure development into discrete, testable stages (e.g., skeleton setup, core components, integrations). Each stage must include: (1) Design spec updates if needed; (2) Code generation/review; (3) Unit/integration tests achieving 80% coverage; (4) Manual verification/debugging; (5) A descriptive commit linking to specs. Progress only after stage validation to ensure stability and traceability.

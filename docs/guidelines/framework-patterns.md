### Modular Components
- Design patterns like Factory or Builder for creating extensible objects.
- Use Observer pattern for hooks (e.g., event emitters in React, Spring's ApplicationEvents).

### Extension Mechanisms
- **Hooks**: Provide callback interfaces (e.g., `OnInitHook` in client components) for custom logic, including theme application. For UX enhancements, include overridable style hooks in base components, such as a `applyTheme` method, to enable cyberpunk styling (dark gray/black/green palette) without modifying core functionality. Document with examples for seamless integration.
- **Abstractions**: Abstract base classes with overridable methods, documented with examples.

### Debugging and Support Integration
- **Client**: Embed React Error Boundaries with custom logging. Advise installing React DevTools extension for state inspection.
- **Server**: Configure Actuator in `application.properties` (e.g., `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`). Recommend using Spring Boot DevTools for auto-reloads during debugging in IntelliJ.
